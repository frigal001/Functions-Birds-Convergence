# Deterministic assembly and anthropogenic extinctions drive convergence of island bird communities

Code accompanying the paper: Triantis et al. Deterministic assembly and anthropogenic extinctions drive convergence of island bird communities (Submitted)

The R scripts can be used to run the analyses in the paper. The code Code_CreateArtificialData.R is to create artifical datasets for three hypothetic archipelagos along with their respective species pool. The code Code_AllFunctions.R contains the main functions to calculate and test morphological and phylogenetic convergence among archipelagos.

The code Code_CreateArtificialData.R creates four datasets
``` r
coloAge.Rdata
```
contains the names of the archipelagos, the numbers of colonization events per archipelago and the maximum geological age for each archipelago.


data.community.Rdata
data.archip.Rdata
