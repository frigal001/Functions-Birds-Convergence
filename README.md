# create dataset archipelago A, B and C with their respective species pool 
# sppool is the tree of the pool, sparchi the tree of the archipelago, traitpool
# the traits of the pool (5 as in the paper) and traitarchi the traits of the archipelago
# for sppool with combined 2 trees of 50 species to differentiate two different families in the pool
# for each family, we will extract the BM rate. Therefore, in the course of our simulation 
# procedure and for a given archipelago A, if a species S, belonging to the family F, 
# has been randomly selected from the pool to colonize archipelago A, 
# and subsequently to give birth to an endemic clade of four species, we (1) used the 
# geological age of archipelago A, and Lambda, mu estimated for the tree of the family F to 
# create the tree of the endemic clade, and (2) the trait value of S as the ancestral state and sigma2 
# estimated for the tree and traits of family F, to generate trait values for the four endemic 
# species along the BD tree previously generated.
