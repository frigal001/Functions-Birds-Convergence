# Deterministic assembly and anthropogenic extinctions drive convergence of island bird communities

Code accompanying the paper: Triantis et al. Deterministic assembly and anthropogenic extinctions drive convergence of island bird communities (Submitted)

The R scripts can be used to run the analyses in the paper. The code Code_CreateArtificialData.R is to create artifical datasets for three hypothetic archipelagos along with their respective species (phylogeny and traits). The code Code_AllFunctions.R contains the main functions to calculate and test morphological and phylogenetic convergence among archipelagos.
